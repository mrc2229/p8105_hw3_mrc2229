Bring in instacart data
-----------------------

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Examining the instacart data
----------------------------

There are 1384617 observations in the instacart dataset and 15 variables in the instacart data set. Some of the key variables are product\_name, which shows the product purchased; aisle, which tells us the aisle the purchased item comes from; and order\_id, which tells us the id of the person who ordered a certain item. So we can see things like that person with order\_id 1 got 2 items from aisle 24, the fresh fruit aisle. The instacart dataset also gives information on the time an order was placed. As and example, the person with order\_id 1 made their order at the 10th hour of the day.
